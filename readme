dnvr - dumb network video recorder

nvr systems out there seem to be either free and bad, or expensive
and also bad. this one is bad too but at least i hacked most of it
together myself.

suppose you have a bunch of ip cameras that speak rtsp. suppose
that you:

- want to stream them in real time to a web browser

- want to record the videos to disk, optionally triggered by (bad)
motion detection

- are not desperate enough to just give up on it all and get a ring
camera

then maybe this cursed thing is for you. but it's probably not.

you give it a bunch of rtsps urls, it gives you a web interface to
view them and a directory of mp4s. and that's it.  there are no
more features.

it uses the pion go package to speak webrtc, and shells out to
ffmpeg to encode mp4s. i recently found out it's a similar approach
to brad fitzpatrick's hack described in his 2016 lightning talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yFb-b5GYWc. i had no recollection
of that talk before writing this, but i was at that conference so
i'm convinced that that's where i learned this trick, and that it
sat dormant in my subconscious for ~5 years.

things it does not and will not do:

- fancy motion detection: if it doesn't work for you maybe use a
proper nvr?

- authentication or authorization: if you want that use a proxy,
or wireguard, or tailscale, or whatever.

- alerts or notifications: i don't need them, so i'm not writing
any code for them. if you need alerts this package is not for you.

- stream videos in mjpeg or hls

- remove old recorded videos. clean them up with a cron job.
